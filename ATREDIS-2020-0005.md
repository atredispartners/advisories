# Garmin Forerunner 235: Missing bounds check in LGETV and LPUTV TVM instructions

## Vendors

* Garmin

## Affected Products

Forerunner 235 firmware version 7.90

## Summary

The ConnectIQ program interpreter fails to check the index provided when accessing the
local variable in the `LGETV` and `LPUTV` instructions. This provides the ability to both read
and write memory outside the bounds of the TVM context allocation. It can be leveraged to
construct a use-after-free scenario leading to a constrained read/write primitive across the
entire MAX32630 address space. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app
store application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted application
execution environment.

## Mitigation

This issue was fixed by [Forerunner 235 software version 8.20](https://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=9575).

## Technical Details

The TVM interpreter is responsible for running the application (or `.PRG`)
downloaded from the Garmin ConnectIQ app store. The `.PRG` file packages both
resources (e.g., images and text) and TVM bytecode needed to run the program. Applications 
are programmed in the proprietary MonkeyC language and are built into `.PRG` 
programs via the free Garmin ConnectIQ SDK. Once on the device,
the virtual machine ensures the applications are strictly constrained to prevent excess use
of memory or computation time. Additionally, the runtime API exposed to each
program is constrained based on the type of application installed (e.g., a watchface, a widget, a full application).

The TVM is a stack-based virtual machine. A set of instructions, `LGETV` and `LPUTV`,
are used to read and write to local variable. The virtual machine maintains a 
frame pointer used to point at the start of the frame on the stack. The
entry of a method will reserve some space on the stack to store local variables.
The `LGETV` and `LPUTV` instructions expect a single byte operand specifying the local 
variable index for that instruction. The implementation does not check that
this index is within the allocated local variable space as seen below.

```
int __fastcall tvm_op_lgetv(struct tvm *ctx)
{
  char *pc_at_entry; // r3
  struct stack_value *sp_at_entry; // r1
  int local_var_idx; // t1
  struct stack_value *local_var_ptr; // r2
  struct stack_value *v6; // r5

  pc_at_entry = ctx->pc_ptr;
  sp_at_entry = ctx->stack_ptr;
  local_var_idx = (unsigned __int8)*pc_at_entry;
  ctx->pc_ptr = pc_at_entry + 1;
  local_var_ptr = &ctx->frame_ptr[local_var_idx + 1];
  ctx->stack_ptr = sp_at_entry + 1;
  sp_at_entry[1] = *local_var_ptr;
  v6 = (struct stack_value *)&ctx->m_0x007b;
  tvm_value_incref(ctx, (struct tvm_value *)ctx->stack_ptr);
  tvm_value_decref(ctx, v6);
  ctx->m_0x007b = (struct tvm_value)*ctx->stack_ptr;
  tvm_value_incref(ctx, (struct tvm_value *)v6);
  return 0;
}
```

The unchecked offset from the `frame_ptr` of the execution context provides
a path to both memory access past the end of the TVM context allocation (the
stack is allocated at the end of this) and a primitive to construct a
use-after-free taking advantage of the way values outside of the valid
stack are treated.

Triggering this requires direct bytecode manipulation of a PRG file (or
construction of one from scratch). There are a number of additional constraints to 
turn this into a reliable read/write anything anywhere primitive but they do not 
seem insurmountable.
