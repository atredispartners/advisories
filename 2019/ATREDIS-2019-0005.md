## Affected Products

## Summary

The Quantum SuperLoader 3 and Dell PowerVault 124T devices can be accessed using a backdoor support account ("fa") that
has a four-character password. The password can be provided by vendor support and is based on a five-digit challenge
code displayed in the telnet banner, HTTP authentication realm, and front panel. This four-character password 
consists of lower case hexadecimal and can be brute forced or derived based on the challenge algorithm.

This issue may affect a wider range of products and firmware versions.
